# Weather app

**Demo: [Weather app](https://dawiddev.github.io/weather-app/)**

Weather app built with:

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS
- AJAX

It is a simple weather app that downloads data from a free source. Completely responsive.
This app uses a free api from AccuWeather so there are 50 data requests per 24 hours available.<br/>
The app was built to complement my Front End Developer portfolio.
